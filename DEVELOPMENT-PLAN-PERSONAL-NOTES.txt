OBJECTIVE
=================
I need to focus on the learning path I started a few weeks ago. I cant deviate from it. If I try to learn new things (eg Math for ML), I will get overwhelmed and I wont be able to complete the first phase of my training that is to become fluent on Python, IDEs, git/github.

My focus has to be to gain experience using the above technlogies and build up a portfolio I can show off. The Python Master course I am taking contains 4 different projects that will help me build the muscle for Technical Interviews. I need to master the fundamentals and build on top of that:

Technologies:

Python 3.x -- WIP
Git and Github -- WIP
IDEs: Sublime Text 2 (WIP), Pycharm (WIP) and/or Visual Studio Code (Not Started)

Other language(s) to learn:
Java?
Javascript?

Along with the above, I need to learn how to deploy applications using CI/CD pipelines. Other related technologies are:

Docker/Kubernetes
Jenkins/Ansible

With the above, I will be able to understand the fundamantals of new deployment methodologies and catch up with the new trend.

TO DO List:
=============
to start taking notes of everything new thing I learn using the above technologies to show the path I am building for myself and use during interviews.
