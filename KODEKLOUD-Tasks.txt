- Create a Linux User with non-interactive shell

  The /etc/passwd file has as the last item on a user's line the program to be run upon login. For normal users this is typically set to /bin/sh or other shell (e.g. bash, zsh).

  Ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4676/creating-a-user-who-cannot-get-an-interactive-shell

  Example:
  $ sudo useradd username
  $ sudo passwd new_passwd

  When executed without any option, useradd creates a new user account using the default settings specified in the /etc/default/useradd file.

  The command adds an entry to the files:
    /etc/passwd,  <--- set /bash/shell to /bash/false
    /etc/shadow,
    /etc/group and
    /etc/gshadow
