TASK 2:
===========
Start Date: 11/20/2020:

- Create a Linux User with non-interactive shell

  The /etc/passwd file has as the last item on a user's line the program to be run upon login. For normal users this is typically set to /bin/sh or other shell (e.g. bash, zsh).

  Ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4676/creating-a-user-who-cannot-get-an-interactive-shell

  Example:
  $ sudo useradd username
  $ sudo passwd new_passwd

  When executed without any option, useradd creates a new user account using the default settings specified in the /etc/default/useradd file.

  The command adds an entry to the files:
    /etc/passwd,  <--- set /bash/shell to /bash/false
    /etc/shadow,
    /etc/group and
    /etc/gshadow

TASK 2:
===========
Start date: 11/22/2020

For security reasons the xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted, rather than its default user. This will be theApache user, so it shouldn't use the default home directory. Create the user as per requirements given below:

a. Create a user named ammar on the App server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.
b. Set UID to 1116 and its home directory to /var/www/ammar.

  $ ssh tony@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com

  $ cat /etc/hosts
  172.16.238.10   stapp01

  $ ssh tony@stapp01

  $ sudo useradd ammar
  $ sudo passwd ammar
  $ sudo usermod -u 1116 ammar  # change user id

  $ sudo usermod -d /var/www/ammar ammar

TASK 3:
===========

xFusionCorp Industries has an application running on Nautlitus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter. The monitoring tool recognised that there is an issue with the haproxy service on LBR server. That needs to fixed to make the application work properly.

Troubleshoot and fix the issue, and make sure haproxy service is running on Nautilus LBR server.

How to check running process in Linux using command line
$ ps -aux
$ sudo ps -a

Ref: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-check-running-process-in-linux-using-command-line/

$ systemctl status haproxy
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/haproxy.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
Active: inactive (dead)

$ systemctl is-enable haproxy
disabled

$ systemctl list-unit-files | grep haproxy
disabled

Ref: https://linoxide.com/linux-command/how-to-list-services-in-linux/

FIX:
----------
Enable the service using sudo. Otherwise, the fix will not work.

$ sudo systemctl enable haproxy
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/haproxy.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/haproxy.service

  - Cause: service was disabled and the symlink to the service was removed.
  - Justification: Running "systemctl disable" removes the symlink to the service in /etc/systemd/system/*. From now on, that service wonâ€™t start on boot anymore. Ref: https://ma.ttias.be/enable-disable-service-at-boot-on-centos-7/

$ systemctl list-unit-files | grep haproxy
haproxy.service   enabled

Ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/158494/the-name-org-freedesktop-policykit1-was-not-provided-by-any-service-files

Failed the test because I missed to bring back up the service:

$ sudo systemctl start haproxy

The complete fix should have been:
$ sudo systemctl enable haproxy
$ sudo systemctl start haproxy

Symlinks:
-----------
A symlink (also called a symbolic link) is a type of file in Linux that points to another file or a folder on your computer. Symlinks are similar to shortcuts in Windows.

TASK 4:
===========

On Nautilus storage server in Stratos DC there is a storage location /data which is used by different developers to keep their data (no confidential data). One of the developers mariyam has raised a ticket and asked for a copy of his/her data present in /data/mariyam directory on storage server. /home is an FTP location on storage server where developers can download their data. Below are the instructions shared by the system admin team to accomplish the task:

a. Make a mariyam.tar.gz compressed archive of /data/mariyam directory and move the archive to /home directory on Storage Server

Storage server:

  Server Information:

  Hostname: ststor01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
  User: natasha
  Password: Bl@kW
  Purpose: Stork DC Storage Filer

How to compress an entire directory:
-------------------------------------
$ tar -zcvf mariyam.tar.gz /path/to/dir/

-z: Filter the archive through gzip
-c: Create a new archive
-v: Verbose output
-f: mariyam.tar.gz <-- Use archive file

How to extract contents to a directory:
----------------------------------------
$ tar -xzvf my.tar.gz -C /home/vivek/backups/
