TASK 2:
===========
Start Date: 11/20/2020:

- Create a Linux User with non-interactive shell

  The /etc/passwd file has as the last item on a user's line the program to be run upon login. For normal users this is typically set to /bin/sh or other shell (e.g. bash, zsh).

  Ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4676/creating-a-user-who-cannot-get-an-interactive-shell

  Example:
  $ sudo useradd username
  $ sudo passwd new_passwd

  When executed without any option, useradd creates a new user account using the default settings specified in the /etc/default/useradd file.

  The command adds an entry to the files:
    /etc/passwd,  <--- set /bash/shell to /bash/false
    /etc/shadow,
    /etc/group and
    /etc/gshadow

TASK 2:
===========
Start date: 11/22/2020

For security reasons the xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted, rather than its default user. This will be theApache user, so it shouldn't use the default home directory. Create the user as per requirements given below:

a. Create a user named ammar on the App server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.
b. Set UID to 1116 and its home directory to /var/www/ammar.

  $ ssh tony@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com

  $ cat /etc/hosts
  172.16.238.10   stapp01

  $ ssh tony@stapp01

  $ sudo useradd ammar
  $ sudo passwd ammar
  $ sudo usermod -u 1116 ammar  # change user id

  $ sudo usermod -d /var/www/ammar ammar
